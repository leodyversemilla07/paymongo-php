Release notes (final draft)

This update focuses on reliability and coverage. Entity constructors now validate required fields and clearly surface missing attributes, while optional fields continue to default to null. We expanded integration-style tests across workflows, policies, ledgers, transfers, wallets, invoices, and related ledger resources, and added broad required-field and error-propagation coverage to keep service behavior consistent and predictable.
